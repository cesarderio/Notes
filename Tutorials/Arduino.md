### **Setting Up Arduino**

Follow these steps to set up your Arduino environment:

1. **Download and Install the Arduino IDE**:

   - Visit the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/) and download the Arduino IDE for your operating system.
   - Install the software following the on-screen instructions.

2. **Connect Your Arduino Board**:

   - Use a USB cable to connect your Arduino board to your computer.

3. **Select Your Board and Port**:

   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to **Tools > Board** and select your Arduino model (e.g., Arduino Uno).
   - Go to **Tools > Port** and choose the port your board is connected to.

<br>

### **Creating and Uploading Your First Sketch**

#### **Write Your First Program**

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Write the following code in the editor:

   ```cpp
   void setup() {
     pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // Set pin 13 as an output
   }

   void loop() {
     digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // Turn on the LED
     delay(1000);           // Wait for 1 second
     digitalWrite(13, LOW);  // Turn off the LED
     delay(1000);           // Wait for 1 second
   }
   ```

#### **Upload the Sketch**

1. Click the **Verify** button (checkmark icon) to compile your code.
2. Click the **Upload** button (arrow icon) to upload the sketch to your board.
3. Observe the built-in LED on your Arduino board blinking on and off.

<br>

## **Notes**

- Always verify your code before uploading it to the board to catch errors early.
- Use external components like LEDs, sensors, and motors to expand your projects.
- Ensure your Arduino board drivers are correctly installed for seamless communication with the IDE.
