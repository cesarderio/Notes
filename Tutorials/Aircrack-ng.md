## **Overview**

Aircrack-ng is a network software suite that includes tools for packet sniffing, WEP/WPA key cracking, and WiFi network analysis. It captures network packets and attempts to crack the network password, making it invaluable for WiFi security testing.

<br>

## **Objectives**

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand the purpose and capabilities of Aircrack-ng.
- Learn to capture network packets and perform basic WiFi security analysis.
- Practice ethical usage of Aircrack-ng tools.

<br>

## **Prerequisites**

- **Hardware**: A wireless network adapter capable of packet injection and monitor mode.
- **Software**:
  - **Linux**: Install Aircrack-ng via package manager (`sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng`).
  - **Windows**: Limited functionality available.
  - **macOS**: Install using tools like MacPorts or Brew.
- **Legal Considerations**: Only use Aircrack-ng on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.

<br>

## **Steps**

### **Installation**

Follow these steps to install Aircrack-ng:

- **Linux**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
  ```

- **Windows**: Download the [Windows version](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) and install it.
- **macOS**: Use Brew:

  ```bash
  brew install aircrack-ng
  ```

<br>

### **Basic Concepts**

#### Understanding WiFi Security

- WiFi networks use security protocols like WEP, WPA, and WPA2.
- Aircrack-ng tests the robustness of these protocols by analyzing captured packets.

#### Required Hardware

- Ensure your network adapter supports **packet injection** and **monitor mode**.

<br>

### **Capturing Packets**

1. Start capturing packets using `airodump-ng`:

   ```bash
   airodump-ng wlan0
   ```

2. Identify the target networkâ€™s:
   - **BSSID**
   - **Channel**
   - **ESSID**


3. Focus on a specific network:

   ```bash
   airodump-ng --bssid [target BSSID] -c [channel] --write [output file] wlan0
   ```

<br>

### **Cracking WEP**

1. Capture enough data packets from the target network.
2. Use Aircrack-ng to crack the WEP key:

   ```bash
   aircrack-ng [output file]-01.cap
   ```



### **Cracking WPA/WPA2**

1. Capture a WPA handshake:
   - Deauthenticate a client if needed (see [Deauthenticating Clients](#deauthenticating-clients)).
2. Use a wordlist to attempt cracking the key:

   ```bash
   aircrack-ng -w [wordlist file] [output file]-01.cap
   ```


<br>

## **Advanced Techniques**

### **Deauthenticating Clients**

To capture a handshake for WPA/WPA2 cracking, force a client to reconnect:

```bash
aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a [target BSSID] -c [client BSSID] wlan0
```



### **Creating a Wordlist**

Generate a custom wordlist using tools like `crunch`:

```bash
crunch [min-length] [max-length] [charset] -o [output file]
```

Example:

```bash
crunch 8 12 abcdef123 > wordlist.txt
```


<br>

## **Best Practices and Tips**

- **Stay Legal**: Only use Aircrack-ng on authorized networks.
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Confirm your adapter supports necessary features.
- **Ethical Usage**: Use Aircrack-ng to improve the security of your own networks.
- **Password Strength**: Promote strong, complex passwords for improved network security.

<!-- # Aircrack-ng Tutorial for Beginners

<br>

## Overview

Aircrack-ng is a network software suite consisting of a detector, packet sniffer, WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK cracker, and analysis tool. It works by capturing network packets and then attempting to crack the network password. This tutorial will guide beginners through the basics of using Aircrack-ng for WiFi security analysis.

<br>

## Installation

- **Linux**: Most distributions provide Aircrack-ng in their repositories. Install it using the package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng`.
- **Windows**: Windows versions are available, but functionality is limited compared to Linux.
- **macOS**: Can be installed using tools like MacPorts or Brew.

<br>

## Basic Concepts

<br>

### Understanding WiFi Security

- WiFi networks typically use WEP, WPA, or WPA2 for security.
- Aircrack-ng can test the strength of these security protocols.

<br>

### Required Hardware

- A wireless network adapter capable of packet injection is required.

<br>

## Using Aircrack-ng

<br>

### Capturing Packets

- Use `airodump-ng` to capture packets from a network.

  ```bash
  airodump-ng wlan0
  ```

- Identify your target network's BSSID, channel, and ESSID.

<br>

### Targeting a Specific Network

- Capture packets from a specific network:

  ```bash
  airodump-ng --bssid [target BSSID] -c [channel] --write [output file] wlan0
  ```

<br>

### Cracking WEP

- After capturing enough data packets, use Aircrack-ng to crack the WEP key:

  ```bash
  aircrack-ng [output file]-01.cap
  ```

<br>

### Cracking WPA/WPA2

- WPA/WPA2 cracking requires a handshake packet.
- Use `airodump-ng` to capture the handshake.
- Use `aircrack-ng` with a wordlist to crack the key:

  ```bash
  aircrack-ng -w [wordlist file] [output file]-01.cap
  ```

<br>

## Advanced Aircrack-ng Techniques

<br>

### Deauthenticating Clients (For Capturing Handshakes)

- Use `aireplay-ng` to deauthenticate a client, forcing a handshake capture:

  ```bash
  aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a [target BSSID] -c [client BSSID] wlan0
  ```

<br>

### Creating a Wordlist

- Custom wordlists can be more effective. Tools like `crunch` can help create them.

<br>

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Legal Considerations**: It's illegal to access or attack a network without permission.
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Ensure your network adapter supports packet injection and monitor mode.
- **Strong Passwords**: Use Aircrack-ng to assess the strength of your network's password, promoting the use of strong, complex passwords.

<br>

## Conclusion

Aircrack-ng is a powerful suite for assessing WiFi network security. It's crucial for network administrators and security professionals to understand these tools to safeguard against vulnerabilities.
