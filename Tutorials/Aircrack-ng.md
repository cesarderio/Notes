## **Overview**

Aircrack-ng is a network software suite that includes tools for packet sniffing, WEP/WPA key cracking, and WiFi network analysis. It captures network packets and attempts to crack the network password, making it invaluable for WiFi security testing.

<br>

## **Objectives**

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand the purpose and capabilities of Aircrack-ng.
- Learn to capture network packets and perform basic WiFi security analysis.
- Practice ethical usage of Aircrack-ng tools.

<br>

## **Prerequisites**

- **Hardware**: A wireless network adapter capable of packet injection and monitor mode.
- **Software**:
  - **Linux**: Install Aircrack-ng via package manager (`sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng`).
  - **Windows**: Limited functionality available.
  - **macOS**: Install using tools like MacPorts or Brew.
- **Legal Considerations**: Only use Aircrack-ng on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.

<br>

## **Steps**

<br>

### **Installation**

Follow these steps to install Aircrack-ng:

- **Linux**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
  ```

- **Windows**: Download the [Windows version](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) and install it.
- **macOS**: Use Brew:

  ```bash
  brew install aircrack-ng
  ```

<br>

### **Basic Concepts**

<br>

#### Understanding WiFi Security

- WiFi networks use security protocols like WEP, WPA, and WPA2.
- Aircrack-ng tests the robustness of these protocols by analyzing captured packets.

#### Required Hardware

- Ensure your network adapter supports **packet injection** and **monitor mode**.

<br>

### **Capturing Packets**

1. Start capturing packets using `airodump-ng`:

   ```bash
   airodump-ng wlan0
   ```

2. Identify the target networkâ€™s:
   - **BSSID**
   - **Channel**
   - **ESSID**

3. Focus on a specific network:

   ```bash
   airodump-ng --bssid [target BSSID] -c [channel] --write [output file] wlan0
   ```

<br>

### **Cracking WEP**

1. Capture enough data packets from the target network.
2. Use Aircrack-ng to crack the WEP key:

   ```bash
   aircrack-ng [output file]-01.cap
   ```

<br>

### **Cracking WPA/WPA2**

1. Capture a WPA handshake:
   - Deauthenticate a client if needed (see [Deauthenticating Clients](#deauthenticating-clients)).
2. Use a wordlist to attempt cracking the key:

   ```bash
   aircrack-ng -w [wordlist file] [output file]-01.cap
   ```

<br>

## **Advanced Techniques**

### **Deauthenticating Clients**

To capture a handshake for WPA/WPA2 cracking, force a client to reconnect:

  ```bash
  aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a [target BSSID] -c [client BSSID] wlan0
  ```

<br>

### **Creating a Wordlist**

Generate a custom wordlist using tools like `crunch`:

  ```bash
  crunch [min-length] [max-length] [charset] -o [output file]
  ```

Example:

  ```bash
  crunch 8 12 abcdef123 > wordlist.txt
  ```

<br>

## **Best Practices and Tips**

- **Stay Legal**: Only use Aircrack-ng on authorized networks.
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Confirm your adapter supports necessary features.
- **Ethical Usage**: Use Aircrack-ng to improve the security of your own networks.
- **Password Strength**: Promote strong, complex passwords for improved network security.
