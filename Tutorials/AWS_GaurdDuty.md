## **Overview**

Understanding cloud detective controls is crucial in the field of cybersecurity, particularly in cloud environments like AWS. Amazon GuardDuty plays a key role in enhancing security by continuously monitoring and analyzing AWS environments for potential threats.

<br>

## **Objectives**

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand the types of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) detected by Amazon GuardDuty.
- Learn about the data sources GuardDuty utilizes for threat detection.
- Explore how GuardDuty uses behavior analysis to identify malicious activity.

<br>

## **Prerequisites**

To follow this tutorial, you should:

- Have an AWS account with GuardDuty enabled.
- Be familiar with basic cybersecurity concepts.
- Have access to AWS services like CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs (optional).

<br>

## **Steps**

### **Indicators of Compromise Detected by GuardDuty**

GuardDuty detects a wide range of cyber threats:

| Indicator                          | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Odd API Calls**                  | Identifies unusual patterns or locations of API calls.                      |
| **Scanning Attempts**              | Detects activities aimed at finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.         |
| **Malware Connections**            | Recognizes communications with servers known for malware distribution.      |
| **Attack Attempts**                | Monitors for brute force attacks or exploitation of open ports.             |
| **Unusual IAM User Behavior**      | Flags deviations from typical user behavior patterns.                       |
| **Data Leaks**                     | Detects abnormal data movements, suggesting potential data exfiltration.    |
| **Unexpected Infrastructure Changes** | Alerts on uncharacteristic changes in the AWS environment.                  |

<br>

### **Data Sources Utilized by GuardDuty**

GuardDuty leverages multiple data sources to provide comprehensive monitoring:

| Data Source                | Role                                                                 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS CloudTrail Event Logs** | Tracks API calls to detect unauthorized or unusual activities.      |
| **DNS Logs**               | Analyzes domain queries to identify malicious activity.              |
| **VPC Flow Logs**          | Examines network traffic for anomalies and known malicious patterns. |

#### **How GuardDuty Uses Data Sources**

1. Collects logs from AWS services like CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs.
2. Correlates log data with threat intelligence feeds.
3. Uses machine learning models to identify suspicious activities.

<br>

### **GuardDuty's Approach to Identifying Malicious Activity**

GuardDuty employs advanced techniques to detect threats:

| Technique                    | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Behavioral Learning**      | Establishes a baseline of normal activity using historical data.            |
| **Access Behavior Analysis** | Monitors deviations from established behavior norms to flag potential threats. |
| **Automated Alerts**         | Generates alerts for detected anomalies, enabling rapid response.           |
| **Integration with AWS Services** | Supports integration with services like Lambda for automated remediation. |

#### **Steps to Enable GuardDuty**

1. Open the **GuardDuty** console in AWS.
2. Click **Get Started** and enable GuardDuty for your account.
3. Configure settings like trusted IP lists or threat intelligence feeds.
4. Review and act on findings in the GuardDuty dashboard.

<br>

## **Notes**

- GuardDuty continuously evolves with updated threat intelligence feeds.
- Use GuardDuty alongside preventative controls like AWS WAF for comprehensive security.
- Regularly review findings to refine your security posture and response strategies.
