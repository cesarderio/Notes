### **System Log Analysis with Event Viewer**

#### **Levels of Events**

| Event Level                     | Description                                                                                  | Example                                |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Information**                 | Logs normal operations of the system or applications.                                       | Application startup.                   |
| **Error**                       | Captures critical system or application issues.                                             | Failed system service initialization.  |
| **Warning**                     | Indicates potential issues that might need attention.                                       | Disk space nearing capacity.           |

#### **Troubleshooting with Event Viewer**

| Task                            | Description                                                                                  | Example                                |

### **Combining Registry and Log Analysis**

| Scenario                        | Registry Use Case                     | Event Viewer Use Case                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Troubleshooting Application Errors | Modify settings to resolve configuration issues. | Check logs for related errors or warnings. |
| System Performance Issues       | Adjust Registry keys to optimize performance.       | Review logs for potential bottlenecks.    |

<br>

## **Examples**

Here’s an example of using the Registry and Event Viewer together:

1. **Identify an Issue in Event Viewer**:
   - Open Event Viewer and navigate to **Windows Logs > System**.
   - Look for **Error** entries and note the Event ID.

2. **Modify the Registry**:
   - Open Registry Editor (`regedit`) and locate the relevant key using online documentation for the Event ID.
   - Backup the key and make necessary changes.

3. **Verify Results**:
   - Restart the system and check the Event Viewer to confirm that the issue has been resolved.

## **Notes**

- Always back up the Registry before making changes to avoid accidental misconfigurations.
- Use Event Viewer logs to identify trends and recurring issues for proactive troubleshooting.
- Avoid unnecessary Registry edits, as incorrect changes can destabilize your system.
