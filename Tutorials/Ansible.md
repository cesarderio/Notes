## **Overview**

Ansible is an open-source automation platform used to automate repetitive tasks like configuration management, application deployment, and complex workflow orchestration. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use.

<br>

## **Objectives**

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Understand the core features of Ansible.
- Learn how to install and configure Ansible.
- Create and use playbooks to automate tasks.
- Explore advanced features like modules and roles.

<br>

## **Prerequisites**

- A basic understanding of command-line interfaces and networking concepts.
- Access to a Linux system or WSL for running Ansible.
- Ansible installed (see [Installation](#installation)).

<br>

## **Steps**

### **Installation**

Install Ansible based on your operating system:

- **Ubuntu/Debian**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install ansible
  ```

- **RedHat/CentOS**:

  ```bash
  sudo yum install ansible
  ```

- **macOS**:

  ```bash
  brew install ansible
  ```

- **Windows**: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to install Ansible.

<br>

### **Ansible Configuration**

- Default configurations are stored in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`.
- Beginners can use the default settings, but advanced users can modify them to suit specific requirements.

<br>

### **Inventory File**

The inventory file lists the nodes or servers managed by Ansible. By default, it’s located at `/etc/ansible/hosts`.

**Example:**

```ini
[webservers]
server1.example.com
server2.example.com

[dbservers]
dbserver.example.com
```

<br>

### **Basic Commands**

- **Ping Nodes**: Check connectivity to your nodes:

  ```bash
  ansible all -m ping -i your_inventory_file
  ```

- **Ad-hoc Commands**: Execute single tasks:

  ```bash
  ansible all -a "/bin/echo hello" -i your_inventory_file
  ```

<br>

## **Playbooks**

Playbooks are YAML files where you define the desired state of your managed nodes. They consist of one or more *plays*, each containing tasks.

<br>

### **Creating Your First Playbook**

1. Create a file named `webserver.yml`:

   ```yaml

   - name: Ensure Apache is installed and running
     hosts: webservers
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - name: Install Apache
         apt:
           name: apache2
           state: present

       - name: Start Apache
         service:
           name: apache2
           state: started
   ```

2. Run the playbook:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook webserver.yml -i your_inventory_file
   ```

<br>

## **Modules**

Modules are reusable, standalone scripts that perform specific tasks on the target machine. Examples include:

- **System Modules**: `user`, `service`
- **Packaging Modules**: `apt`, `yum`

<br>

## **Roles**

Roles provide a way to organize and reuse Ansible tasks, templates, variables, and modules.

### **Creating a Simple Role**

1. Create a role structure:

   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy init your_role_name
   ```

2. Edit the `tasks/main.yml` file to define tasks.
3. Add templates or files in the respective directories, if needed.

<br>

## **Best Practices and Tips**

- **Idempotency**: Ensure tasks don’t alter the system state unnecessarily if already completed.
- **Use Variables**: Avoid hard-coding values for flexibility and reusability.
- **Task Naming**: Always provide descriptive names for tasks.
- **Version Control**: Store playbooks and roles in a version control system like Git.

- [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com) for pre-built roles and modules.
