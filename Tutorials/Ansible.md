## **Overview**

Ansible is an open-source automation platform used to automate repetitive tasks like configuration management, application deployment, and complex workflow orchestration. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use.

---

## **Objectives**

By the end of this guide, you will:
- Understand the core features of Ansible.
- Learn how to install and configure Ansible.
- Create and use playbooks to automate tasks.
- Explore advanced features like modules and roles.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- A basic understanding of command-line interfaces and networking concepts.
- Access to a Linux system or WSL for running Ansible.
- Ansible installed (see [Installation](#installation)).

---

## **Steps**

### **Installation**

Install Ansible based on your operating system:

- **Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ansible
  ```
- **RedHat/CentOS**:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install ansible
  ```
- **macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install ansible
  ```
- **Windows**: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to install Ansible.

---

### **Ansible Configuration**

- Default configurations are stored in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`.
- Beginners can use the default settings, but advanced users can modify them to suit specific requirements.

---

### **Inventory File**

The inventory file lists the nodes or servers managed by Ansible. By default, it’s located at `/etc/ansible/hosts`.

**Example:**
```ini
[webservers]
server1.example.com
server2.example.com

[dbservers]
dbserver.example.com
```

---

### **Basic Commands**

- **Ping Nodes**: Check connectivity to your nodes:
  ```bash
  ansible all -m ping -i your_inventory_file
  ```
- **Ad-hoc Commands**: Execute single tasks:
  ```bash
  ansible all -a "/bin/echo hello" -i your_inventory_file
  ```

---

## **Playbooks**

### **Introduction to Playbooks**

Playbooks are YAML files where you define the desired state of your managed nodes. They consist of one or more *plays*, each containing tasks.

---

### **Creating Your First Playbook**

1. Create a file named `webserver.yml`:
   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Ensure Apache is installed and running
     hosts: webservers
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - name: Install Apache
         apt:
           name: apache2
           state: present

       - name: Start Apache
         service:
           name: apache2
           state: started
   ```
2. Run the playbook:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook webserver.yml -i your_inventory_file
   ```

---

## **Modules**

Modules are reusable, standalone scripts that perform specific tasks on the target machine. Examples include:
- **System Modules**: `user`, `service`
- **Packaging Modules**: `apt`, `yum`

---

## **Roles**

Roles provide a way to organize and reuse Ansible tasks, templates, variables, and modules.

### **Creating a Simple Role**

1. Create a role structure:
   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy init your_role_name
   ```
2. Edit the `tasks/main.yml` file to define tasks.
3. Add templates or files in the respective directories, if needed.

---

## **Best Practices and Tips**

- **Idempotency**: Ensure tasks don’t alter the system state unnecessarily if already completed.
- **Use Variables**: Avoid hard-coding values for flexibility and reusability.
- **Task Naming**: Always provide descriptive names for tasks.
- **Version Control**: Store playbooks and roles in a version control system like Git.

- [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com) for pre-built roles and modules.

<!-- # Ansible for Beginners: A Comprehensive Guide

<br>

## What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation platform. It's used to automate tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration of complex workflows. Its main goals are simplicity and ease-of-use.

<br>

## Basic Management

<br>

### Installation

To install Ansible:

1. **For Ubuntu/Debian**: Use `sudo apt install ansible`.
2. **For RedHat/CentOS**: Use `sudo yum install ansible`.
3. **For macOS**: Use `brew install ansible`.
4. **Windows**: Windows is not directly supported, but it can be run from within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

<br>

### Ansible Configuration

Ansible configurations can be done in the `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` file, although defaults are generally good for starters.

<br>

### Inventory File

The inventory file (default location is `/etc/ansible/hosts`) is where you list the nodes or servers you want Ansible to manage.

Example:

```bash
[webservers]
server1.example.com
server2.example.com

[dbservers]
dbserver.example.com
```

<br>

### Basic Commands

- **Ping**: To check connectivity to your nodes: `ansible all -m ping -i your_inventory_file`.
- **Ad-hoc Commands**: Execute single tasks with Ansible commands. Example: `ansible all -a "/bin/echo hello" -i your_inventory_file`.

<br>

## Ansible Playbooks

<br>

### Introduction to Playbooks

Playbooks are YAML files where you define the desired states of your managed nodes. They can include one or multiple plays.

<br>

### Creating Your First Playbook

Create a file named `webserver.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure Apache is installed and running
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present

    - name: Start Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
```

To run this playbook, use `ansible-playbook webserver.yml -i your_inventory_file`.

<br>

## Ansible Modules

Modules are discrete units of code that get executed in the target machine. Examples include system modules (like `user` and `service`) and packaging modules (like `apt` and `yum`).

<br>

## Ansible Roles

Roles are a way to group multiple tasks together into one container to do automated tasks for the server. They provide a framework for fully independent or interdependent collections of files, tasks, templates, variables, and modules.

<br>

### Creating a Simple Role

1. **Create Role Structure**: Use `ansible-galaxy init your_role_name` to create a skeleton role.
2. **Add Tasks**: Edit the `tasks/main.yml` file to add tasks.
3. **Add Templates/Files**: If needed, add templates or files in the respective directories.

<br>

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Idempotency**: Design playbooks to be idempotent – running them repeatedly should not change the system state after the first successful run.
- **Use Variables**: For reusable code, use variables rather than hard-coding values.
- **Task Naming**: Always name your tasks to understand what each task is doing.
- **Version Control**: Keep your playbooks and roles in a version control system like Git.

<br>

## Conclusion

Ansible is a versatile tool ideal for simplifying complex tasks. Through playbooks and roles, Ansible provides a clear, concise way to manage your IT infrastructure.
