## **Overview**

CasaOS is a lightweight, Docker-based platform designed for home cloud management. It provides an intuitive web interface for managing Docker applications, personal data, and home services. CasaOS is ideal for users who want a simple, yet powerful system to manage their home cloud.

<br>

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A computer or Raspberry Pi where you want to run CasaOS.
- Docker installed on your system. If you haven't installed Docker yet, refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

<br>

## **Installation**

### **Step 1: Install CasaOS**

CasaOS provides an easy installation method using a one-line script. To install, run the following command in your terminal:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io -o get-casaos.sh && sh get-casaos.sh
  ```

This script will automatically download and install CasaOS along with all necessary dependencies.

<br>

### **Step 2: Access CasaOS**

Once the installation is complete, you can access the CasaOS interface through your web browser:

  ```yaml
  http://<YOUR-SERVER-IP>:80
  ```

Replace `<YOUR-SERVER-IP>` with the IP address of the system where CasaOS is installed. This will open the CasaOS dashboard.

<br>

## **Initial Setup**

Upon accessing CasaOS in your browser, you'll be greeted with the dashboard. From here, you can configure and manage your home cloud.

### **Configuring CasaOS**

- **Dashboard**: View system status and quick information about your setup.
- **App Store**: Easily browse and install Docker-based applications.
- **File Management**: Organize and manage the files stored in CasaOS.
- **Settings**: Adjust system settings, network configurations, and other preferences.

<br>

### **Adding Applications**

To install applications via the CasaOS App Store:

1. Open the **App Store** from the left sidebar.
2. Browse or search for applications you'd like to install.
3. Click on the application and follow the prompts to install it.

<br>

### **File Management**

CasaOS simplifies the management of your files:

1. Go to the **Files** section from the dashboard.
2. You can upload, download, and organize files in this section.
