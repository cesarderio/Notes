## **Steps**

### **Understanding AWS Abstractions for Non-Techies**

AWS simplifies cloud computing with multiple levels of abstraction:

| Level                          | Description                                                                                  | Analogy                                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure**             | Physical hardware and network setup.                                                         | The foundation of a building.              |
| **Compute**                    | Virtual machines and compute instances.                                                      | A virtual office in that building.         |
| **Service**                    | Pre-built, ready-to-use AWS services.                                                        | Pre-furnished office spaces.               |
| **Application**                | Tools for building and deploying custom applications.                                        | Designing your own office space.           |

### **Demystifying Container Abstraction**

Containers operate through two main components: the **control plane** and the **data plane**.

---

#### **Control Plane**

| Feature                        | Description                                                                                  | Example Use Case                             |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Orchestration**              | Manages deployment, scaling, and monitoring.                                                | Kubernetes managing container clusters.      |
| **Resource Allocation**        | Allocates compute and memory resources.                                                     | Scaling resources during high traffic.       |

## **Examples**

### **Example 1: Setting Up an AWS Lambda Function**

1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigate to **AWS Lambda** and click **Create Function**.
3. Choose:
   - **Author from Scratch**.
   - Specify runtime (e.g., Python 3.9).
4. Configure the function:
   - Upload your code or write it in the inline editor.
   - Test the function using a sample event.
5. Deploy and integrate the function with other AWS services (e.g., S3 or DynamoDB).

---

### **Example 2: Configuring a Kubernetes Cluster on AWS**

1. Use **Amazon EKS** to set up a managed Kubernetes cluster.
2. Configure the control plane:
   - Define node groups and instance types.
   - Set up IAM roles for cluster access.
3. Deploy your first application:
   - Use `kubectl` to create pods and services.
   - Monitor the deployment using the Kubernetes dashboard.

## **Notes**

- Cloud security requires regular updates and audits to address evolving threats.
- Leverage AWS services like **GuardDuty** and **Inspector** for enhanced security.
- Test and validate all configurations in a controlled environment before deployment.
