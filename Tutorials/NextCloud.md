# Nextcloud Installation Tutorial

This tutorial provides detailed instructions for installing and setting up Nextcloud, a self-hosted file sync and share server, on a Linux server. Nextcloud allows you to store, access, and share files, contacts, calendars, and more, all while maintaining full control over your data.

## Prerequisites

1. **Linux Server**: A Linux-based server (e.g., Ubuntu) with root access.
2. **Domain Name**: A domain name pointing to your server's IP address (optional but recommended).
3. **Web Server**: Apache or Nginx web server installed and configured on your server.
4. **PHP**: PHP installed on your server (version 7.2 or later recommended).
5. **Database Server**: MySQL or MariaDB database server installed and configured on your server.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install Nextcloud on your Linux server:

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Ensure that your system is up to date and install the necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install apache2 mariadb-server libapache2-mod-php php-gd php-json php-mysql php-curl php-mbstring php-intl php-imagick php-xml php-zip unzip
```

### Step 2: Configure Database

Log in to MySQL/MariaDB:

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

Create a new database and user for Nextcloud:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;
CREATE USER 'nextclouduser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'nextclouduser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

### Step 3: Download Nextcloud

Download the latest version of Nextcloud:

```bash
wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/latest.zip
```

Unzip the downloaded file:

```bash
sudo unzip latest.zip -d /var/www/
```

Set appropriate permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/nextcloud/
```

### Step 4: Configure Web Server

#### For Apache

Create a new virtual host configuration file for Nextcloud:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf
```

Add the following configuration:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin admin@example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/nextcloud/
    ServerName your_domain.com

    <Directory /var/www/nextcloud/>
        Options +FollowSymlinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
        Satisfy Any
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Enable the new virtual host and Apache modules:

```bash
sudo a2ensite nextcloud.conf
sudo a2enmod rewrite headers env dir mime setenvif ssl
```

#### For Nginx

Create a server block configuration file for Nextcloud:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextcloud
```

Add the following configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com;
    root /var/www/nextcloud/;

    # Add Nginx configuration here (refer to tutorial for details)
}
```

Enable the new server block and reload Nginx:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextcloud /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Step 5: Complete Installation via Web Browser

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://your_domain.com`. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation of Nextcloud. Make sure to choose MySQL/MariaDB as the database and provide the database username, password, and database name created in Step 2.

### Step 6: Finalize Configuration

After completing the installation, make sure to configure a trusted domain for your Nextcloud instance. This can be done by editing the Nextcloud configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php
```

Add your domain to the `'trusted_domains'` array.

### Step 7: Secure Your Nextcloud Instance (Optional but Recommended)

To ensure the security of your Nextcloud instance, consider implementing HTTPS using a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate. You can use Certbot for this purpose. Install Certbot:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
```

Obtain and install the SSL certificate:

```bash
sudo certbot --apache -d your_domain.com
```

Follow the prompts to configure HTTPS for your Nextcloud instance.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and configured Nextcloud on your Linux server. You can now start using Nextcloud to store and sync your files, contacts, calendars, and more, all while maintaining full control over your data.
