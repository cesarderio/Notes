## **Steps**

### **SPAN vs TAP: Understanding the Differences**

Traffic mirroring can be implemented using SPAN or TAP, each with unique features and applications.

| Method                         | Description                                                                                  | Example Use Case                             |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer)** | Mirrors all traffic passing through a switch, potentially impacting performance.             | Monitoring traffic on a managed switch.      |
| **TAP (Terminal Access Point)**   | Captures traffic between two specific network points with greater precision.                 | Analyzing data flows between a server and client.|

### **Role of Network Devices in Traffic Mirroring**

Devices such as routers, managed switches, firewalls, and network TAPs enable traffic mirroring:

| Device                         | Role in Traffic Mirroring                                                                    | Example Use Case                             |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Managed Switch**             | Implements SPAN to mirror traffic across multiple ports.                                     | Capturing all VLAN traffic for analysis.     |
| **Router**                     | Mirrors traffic from specific interfaces for monitoring.                                     | Observing WAN traffic in real-time.          |
| **Firewall**                   | Monitors and mirrors data packets passing through security rules.                            | Investigating suspicious network activity.   |
| **Network TAP**                | Provides precise traffic capture without impacting performance.                              | Forensic analysis of network breaches.       |

|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Real-Time Monitoring**       | Detects anomalies or malicious activities as they occur.                                     | Identifying DDoS attacks in progress.      |
| **Investigation and Analysis** | Provides detailed data for post-incident investigation.                                      | Analyzing logs after a ransomware attack.  |
| **Control and Safety**         | Ensures better control over network activities.                                              | Monitoring critical business applications. |

## **Examples**

### **Example 1: Setting Up SPAN on a Managed Switch**

1. Access the switch’s management interface.
2. Navigate to the **SPAN Configuration** section.
3. Configure the source port (where traffic originates) and the destination port (where mirrored traffic will be sent).
4. Apply the configuration and verify mirrored traffic using a tool like Wireshark.

---

### **Example 2: Using a TAP for Traffic Analysis**

1. Install a hardware TAP between a server and its client connection.
2. Connect the TAP output to a monitoring system or laptop running packet analysis software.
3. Start capturing and analyzing the traffic to identify patterns or anomalies.

---

## **Notes**

- **Performance Impact**: While SPAN is convenient, it may degrade switch performance under heavy traffic loads.
- **TAP Precision**: TAPs are ideal for forensic analysis as they provide unaltered traffic capture.
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure that all traffic monitoring activities are documented and compliant with regulations.
