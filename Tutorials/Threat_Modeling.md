## **Overview**

Threat modeling is an essential practice in cybersecurity that proactively identifies and mitigates potential threats during the development of web applications. It ensures that security is integrated into the design and development process from the start.

<br>

## **Objectives**

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand the concept of threat modeling using relatable analogies.
- Learn the four guiding questions that structure the threat modeling process.
- Explore the benefits of threat modeling in project settings.

<br>

## **Prerequisites**

To follow this tutorial, you should:

- Have a basic understanding of web application development.
- Be familiar with cybersecurity concepts and risk assessment.
- Have access to a team or project setting for practical application.

<br>

## **Steps**

### **Simplifying Threat Modeling with Real-World Analogies**

Understanding threat modeling becomes easier with relatable analogies:

| Real-World Analogy           | Explanation                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Home Security Assessment** | Analyzing potential entry points for burglars, evaluating locks, and planning countermeasures. |
| **Trip Planning**            | Anticipating risks, such as delays or breakdowns, and preparing solutions to address them.       |

#### **Non-Technical Explanation**

Think of threat modeling as assessing your homeâ€™s security. You identify potential vulnerabilities (e.g., unlocked windows), anticipate threats (e.g., burglary), and implement safeguards (e.g., installing better locks).

<br>

### **Four Guiding Questions of Threat Modeling**

These questions form the foundation of the threat modeling process:

| Question                   | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What are we working on?**| Identifies components and functionality of the web application.         |
| **What can go wrong?**     | Highlights potential threats, weaknesses, and attack vectors.           |
| **What are we going to do about it?**| Develops strategies to mitigate identified risks and vulnerabilities. |
| **Did we do a good job?**  | Evaluates and refines the implemented security measures.                |

#### **Steps for Applying These Questions**

1. Create a comprehensive list of application components.
2. Conduct brainstorming sessions to identify threats.
3. Develop and implement mitigation strategies.
4. Continuously evaluate and update the threat model.

<br>

### **Advocating for Threat Modeling in Project Development**

Threat modeling offers numerous benefits that resonate with project teams:

| Benefit                    | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Proactive Risk Mitigation**| Identifies and addresses vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.|
| **Clear Security Roadmap** | Provides a structured approach to secure application development.           |
| **Team Alignment**         | Ensures all team members understand and prioritize security measures.        |

#### **Explaining the Benefits to Teams**

Think of threat modeling as creating a detailed map and plan before embarking on a journey. It highlights potential threats and weak points, enabling the team to proactively address security issues and build a more robust application.

<br>

## **Notes**

- Threat modeling is an iterative process that should be revisited as applications evolve.
- Collaboration among developers, security experts, and stakeholders enhances the effectiveness of threat modeling.
- Integrate threat modeling tools like Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool or OWASP Threat Dragon to streamline the process.
