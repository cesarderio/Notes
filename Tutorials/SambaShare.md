# Setting up SambaShare files and directories

<br>

## For Linux (Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi):

1. **Install File Sharing Software** (Samba):
   - Open a terminal and update your package lists: `sudo apt update`.
   - Install Samba with `sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin`.

2. **Configure Samba**:
   - Edit the Samba configuration file: `sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf`.
   - Add your shared folder details at the end of the file.

3. **Set Up Samba User**:
   - Create a Samba user: `sudo smbpasswd -a your_username`.
   - Enter a password when prompted.

4. **Restart Samba**:
   - Restart the Samba service: `sudo systemctl restart smbd`.

5. **Access the Shared Folder**:
   - Access it from other devices using the network path.

6. **Security**:
   - Keep your system updated and use strong passwords.

## For Windows:

1. **Select Folder to Share**:
   - Right-click the folder you want to share.
   - Choose "Properties" and then the "Sharing" tab.

2. **Advanced Sharing**:
   - Click on "Advanced Sharing".
   - Check "Share this folder" and set permissions.

3. **Network Discovery**:
   - Ensure network discovery is turned on in your network settings.

4. **Access the Shared Folder**:
   - Access it from other devices using `\\ComputerName\SharedFolderName`.

## For macOS:

1. **Choose Folder to Share**:
   - Open System Preferences and go to "Sharing".
   - Select "File Sharing" and add the folder you want to share.

2. **Set Permissions**:
   - Set the desired access permissions for the shared folder.

3. **Connect from Other Devices**:
   - On a Mac, connect via Finder > Go > Connect to Server (`smb://MacName/SharedFolder`).
   - On Windows, use `\\MacName\SharedFolder`.

## Cross-Platform Access:

- Accessing from Linux to Windows/Mac and vice versa involves using SMB/CIFS protocols.
- Ensure that the network paths are correctly entered based on the host's OS and shared folder name.
- Compatibility might vary, and additional software (like Samba for Linux) might be needed for seamless integration.

<br>

## Security Tips:

- Always ensure that the network you are using is secure.
- Regularly update your systems and software.
- Use strong, unique passwords for user accounts and shared folders.
- Consider network security measures like firewalls and VPNs, especially in a business environment.
