## **Steps**

### **Explaining the Role of a Cyber Threat Analyst**

Cyber Threat Analysts act as digital detectives, ensuring the security of an organization’s systems:

| Responsibility               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Threat Monitoring**        | Continuously monitors systems for unusual activities or potential threats.  |
| **Incident Investigation**   | Analyzes suspicious activities to identify the root cause and impact.       |
| **Security Research**        | Studies emerging threats and vulnerabilities to improve defenses.          |
| **Incident Reporting**       | Provides detailed reports on security incidents to stakeholders.           |

#### **Non-Technical Explanation**

Think of a Cyber Threat Analyst as a digital detective, safeguarding an organization’s virtual assets by investigating unusual activities and preventing potential breaches.

<br>

### **PowerShell as an Effective Attack Vector**

PowerShell is often exploited in cyber attacks due to its versatility and integration with Windows:

| Characteristic               | Explanation                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Built-in Tool**            | Comes pre-installed on Windows systems, making it easily accessible.        |
| **Stealth Capabilities**     | Operates under the radar, often bypassing traditional security measures.    |
| **Scripting Power**          | Executes complex commands and scripts, enabling attackers to automate tasks.|

#### **Why Attackers Use PowerShell**

1. Easily available on most Windows machines.
2. Capable of running scripts without requiring additional software.
3. Difficult to detect without proper logging and monitoring.

<br>

### **Mitigating PowerShell-Based Attacks**

Implementing proactive measures can reduce the risk of PowerShell-based attacks:

| Strategy                     | Benefit                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Enable PowerShell Logging**| Records all activities for better visibility and threat analysis.      |
| **Constrained Language Mode**| Restricts available commands, limiting the potential for misuse.        |
| **Script Block Logging**     | Captures the content of executed scripts for detailed monitoring.       |

#### **Steps to Enable PowerShell Logging**

1. Open the **Group Policy Management Console**.
2. Navigate to **Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows PowerShell**.
3. Enable **Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging**.
4. Apply and save changes.

<br>

## **Notes**

- PowerShell is a powerful tool but must be used responsibly to prevent exploitation.
- Regularly update and patch systems to minimize vulnerabilities.
- Use security tools like Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to enhance monitoring.
