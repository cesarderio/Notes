By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand the basics of CIDR notation and how to calculate IP ranges.
- Learn the importance of network segmentation for security and performance.
- Explore practical applications of segmentation, such as screened subnets and VLANs.

<br>

## **Prerequisites**

To follow this tutorial, you should:

- Have a basic understanding of IP addressing and subnetting.
- Access to a network environment or simulation tools like Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Familiarity with network security concepts.

<br>

## **Steps**

### **Understanding CIDR Notation**

CIDR notation is a modern approach to defining IP ranges and subnets.

#### **Key Elements of CIDR**

| Concept                        | Description                                                                                  | Example                                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **IPv4 Address**               | Consists of four octets, each ranging from 0 to 255.                                         | `192.168.1.1`                              |
| **CIDR Block**                 | Specifies a range of IPs using slash notation.                                               | `192.168.1.0/24`                           |
| **Subnet Mask**                | Defines the division between network and host portions.                                      | `/24` corresponds to `255.255.255.0`.      |

#### **CIDR Example: 10.0.0.0/24**

- **Range**: Includes IPs from `10.0.0.0` to `10.0.0.255`.
- **Total Addresses**: 256 (2^8 addresses for 8 host bits).

### **The Role of Network Segmentation**

Network segmentation divides a large network into smaller, more manageable subnets.

#### **Importance of Segmentation**

| Benefit                        | Description                                                                                  | Example                                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Enhanced Security**          | Limits access to critical resources even if a firewall is breached.                          | Prevents lateral movement in cyberattacks. |
| **Improved Performance**       | Reduces congestion by isolating traffic within segments.                                     | Segregates VoIP and data traffic.          |
| **Easier Management**          | Simplifies network troubleshooting and monitoring.                                           | Smaller subnets mean fewer devices to track.|

#### **Screened Subnets**

| Use Case                       | Description                                                                                  | Example                                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Buffer Zone**                | Protects internal resources by exposing only necessary services to external networks.        | Place web servers in a screened subnet.    |
| **Access Control**             | Implements strict rules for traffic entering or leaving the subnet.                         | Allow HTTP/HTTPS but block SSH access.     |

#### **Physical Security Measures**

| Measure                        | Description                                                                                  | Example                                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Cameras and Monitoring**     | Monitors physical access to network equipment.                                               | Install cameras near data center racks.    |
| **ID Scanners and Biometric Locks** | Restricts access to authorized personnel only.                                             | Use fingerprint or card-based entry systems.|

| **Classful Subnetting**        | Learn the basics of subnetting with fixed classful boundaries.                               | [Professor Messer - Subnetting](https://www.professormesser.com) |
| **VLANs and Trunking**         | Understand the creation and configuration of VLANs for traffic segregation.                  | [VLAN Tutorial](https://www.professormesser.com) |

---

## **Examples**

### **Example 1: Calculating a CIDR Range**

- Given `192.168.10.0/26`:
  - **Subnet Mask**: `/26` = `255.255.255.192`.
  - **IP Range**: `192.168.10.0` to `192.168.10.63`.
  - **Total Addresses**: 64 (2^(32 - 26)).

### **Example 2: Configuring a Screened Subnet**

1. Create a subnet in your network for public-facing services.
2. Configure firewall rules:
   - Allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
   - Deny all other inbound traffic.
3. Place web servers in this subnet to isolate them from internal resources.

## **Notes**

- CIDR notation provides flexibility in subnet design, optimizing IP address usage.
- Always document your network segmentation and routing configurations for easier troubleshooting and audits.
- Use VLANs to implement logical segmentation without needing separate physical networks.
