- Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts.
- Access to the AWS Management Console.

<br>

## **Steps**

### **Understanding Cloud Virtualization**

#### **What is Virtualization?**

Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of physical resources, such as servers or storage. AWS uses virtualization to enable the dynamic allocation of resources, allowing users to scale workloads up or down as needed.

#### **Introduction to Amazon EC2**

| Feature                        | Description                                                                                  | Example Use Case                             |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Scalable Compute**           | Provides resizable compute capacity to meet changing needs.                                 | Launch additional instances during peak traffic. |
| **Pay-as-You-Go**              | Pay only for the compute time you use, reducing costs.                                       | Save money by stopping idle instances.      |
| **Global Reach**               | Instances can be launched in multiple regions and availability zones for redundancy.        | Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.|

### **The Role of Hypervisors in EC2**

Hypervisors are key to EC2's virtualization capabilities. AWS uses custom hypervisors to manage customer instances efficiently.

| Concept                        | Description                                                                                  | Example                                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Hypervisor**                 | Virtual Machine Manager that allocates resources to virtual instances.                       | AWS Nitro Hypervisor.                     |
| **Efficiency**                 | Enables multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server.                        | Optimizes resource utilization.            |

### **Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and Virtual Machine Creation**

AMIs are preconfigured templates for creating virtual machines (EC2 instances).

| Task                            | Description                                                                                  | Example                                    |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Create an AMI**               | Customize an instance and save it as an AMI for reuse.                                       | Launch multiple instances with identical setups. |
| **Launch Instance**             | Use an AMI to create an EC2 instance.                                                       | Select an Amazon Linux 2 AMI and launch.   |
| **Backup AMIs**                 | Regularly back up AMIs to ensure disaster recovery readiness.                                | Store AMIs in Amazon S3.                  |

### **High-Level Architecture of EC2**

The architecture includes:

1. **Availability Zones**: Distribute instances across zones for fault tolerance.
2. **Storage Options**:
   - **Ephemeral Storage**: Temporary storage tied to the instance lifecycle.
   - **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: Persistent storage that survives instance termination.
3. **Monitoring**: Use Amazon CloudWatch for performance monitoring and alerts.

| Component                       | Description                                                                                  | Example                                    |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**   | Persistent block storage for EC2 instances.                                                  | Attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance.  |
| **CloudWatch**                  | Monitor performance and resource usage.                                                     | Set up alarms for high CPU utilization.   |

## **Examples**

### **Launching an EC2 Instance with an AMI**

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to **EC2** and click **Launch Instance**.
3. Select an Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
4. Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).
5. Configure instance details, add storage, and review settings.
6. Click **Launch** and select a key pair for SSH access.

### **Using CloudWatch to Monitor an Instance**

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to **CloudWatch**.
2. Select **Metrics** > **EC2**.
3. Choose an instance and view metrics such as CPU utilization and disk I/O.
4. Set up an alarm to trigger when CPU usage exceeds 80%.

## **Notes**

- Use AMIs to standardize deployments across your infrastructure.
- Always monitor EC2 instances with CloudWatch to avoid unexpected performance issues.
- Optimize costs by stopping or terminating unused instances.
