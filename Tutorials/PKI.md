## **Overview**

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework used to secure online communications and verify the authenticity of digital entities. It plays a vital role in digital security by encrypting data and establishing trust.

<br>

## **Objectives**

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand the main components of PKI and their roles.
- Learn how PKI is used in everyday online interactions.
- Recognize the vulnerabilities within PKI architecture.

<br>

## **Prerequisites**

To follow this tutorial, you should:

- Have a basic understanding of encryption and digital security concepts.
- Be familiar with terms like “Certificate Authority” and “digital certificates.”
- Access to a browser to observe HTTPS connections and certificate details.

<br>

## **Steps**

### **The Three Pillars of PKI**

Understanding the integral components of PKI is essential for grasping its functionality:

| Component                | Role                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Certificate Authority (CA)** | Issues and manages digital certificates. Verifies the authenticity of entities and signs certificates. |
| **Registration Authority (RA)** | Acts as an intermediary between entities and the CA. Validates entity information before forwarding requests for certificates. |
| **Certificate Repository**    | A secure storage for issued certificates. Facilitates access, retrieval, and validation of certificates. |

<br>

### **PKI in Everyday Internet Use**

PKI simplifies secure communication between your browser and a web server:

| Aspect              | Explanation                                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encryption**      | PKI encrypts your data, turning it into a secret code decipherable only by the intended recipient. |
| **Digital Certificates** | Establish the credibility of websites, ensuring users interact with trusted entities.       |
| **Public and Private Keys** | Your browser encrypts data using a website’s public key, which only the website’s private key can decrypt. |
| **Trusted Authorities** | CAs issue and validate digital certificates, guaranteeing the legitimacy of websites.      |

<br>

### **Recognizing the Weakness in PKI Architecture**

PKI has a notable vulnerability:

| Weakness                                                                 | Impact                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Any Certificate Authority can sign a certificate for any entity.        | Can lead to trust issues, as certificates may be misused or fraudulently issued.    |

<br>

## **Notes**

- PKI relies on the trustworthiness of Certificate Authorities.
- Understanding how digital certificates are issued and validated can enhance your awareness of online security.
- Regularly inspect website certificates in your browser to verify their authenticity.
