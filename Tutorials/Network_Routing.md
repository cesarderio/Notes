## **Steps**

### **Understanding VirtualBox Network Modes**

VirtualBox offers multiple network modes to suit various connectivity requirements.

#### **Key Network Modes**

| Mode                          | Description                                                                                  | Use Case                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Not Attached**              | Disconnects the VM from the network, isolating it completely.                                | Testing software in an offline environment.|
| **Bridged**                   | Connects the VM directly to the host's physical network.                                     | Running servers or services accessible on the local network. |
| **NAT (Network Address Translation)** | Allows the VM to share the host's internet connection but hides it from the local network. | General internet access for VMs.           |

#### **Promiscuous Mode Options**

| Option                        | Description                                                                                  | Use Case                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Deny**                      | Hides all traffic not intended for the VM.                                                   | Default option for isolated VMs.           |
| **Allow VMs**                 | Allows visibility of traffic between VMs on the same host.                                   | Inter-VM communication testing.            |
| **Allow All**                 | Removes all restrictions, exposing all network traffic.                                      | Network monitoring or packet capture.      |

### **Configuring Port Forwarding**

Port forwarding redirects traffic from a specific port on the host to a port on the VM.

| Step                           | Description                                                                                  | Example                                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Open VM Settings               | Navigate to **Settings > Network** for the target VM.                                        | Configure network settings.               |
| Enable NAT                    | Select NAT as the network mode.                                                              | Choose NAT from the dropdown menu.         |
| Add Port Forwarding Rule       | Define the host port, guest port, and protocol in the **Port Forwarding** settings.          | Forward port 8080 on the host to port 80 on the VM.|

### **Exploring Network Routing Concepts**

Routing ensures efficient data transmission across networks.

#### **Dynamic Routing and Switching**

| Concept                        | Description                                                                                  | Example                                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Dynamic Routing**            | Automatically updates routes based on network changes.                                       | Use protocols like OSPF or BGP.           |
| **Switching**                  | Directs data packets within the same network.                                                | Manage traffic within a LAN.              |

### **Practical Use Cases**

| Scenario                       | VirtualBox Network Mode            | Routing/Port Forwarding Configuration        |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Hosting a Web Server           | Bridged                           | No port forwarding needed; directly accessible on the network. |
| Secure Remote Access           | NAT                               | Forward SSH (port 22) from the host to the VM.|
| Isolated Development Environment | Not Attached                     | No additional configuration required.        |

<br>

## **Examples**

### **Example 1: Setting Up Port Forwarding in VirtualBox**

1. Open VirtualBox and select the target VM.
2. Go to **Settings > Network** and select **NAT** as the network mode.
3. Click **Advanced > Port Forwarding** and add a new rule:
   - **Host Port**: 2222
   - **Guest Port**: 22
   - **Protocol**: TCP
4. Save and restart the VM.
5. SSH into the VM using the host's IP address and the specified host port:

   ```bash
   ssh -p 2222 user@host_ip
   ```

### **Example 2: Dynamic Routing with OSPF**

1. Set up two routers in a simulated network.
2. Enable OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) on each router.
3. Verify that routes are dynamically updated using the `show ip route` command.

## **Notes**

- **Network Modes**: Use Bridged mode for VMs that need direct access to the host's network, and NAT for general internet access.
- **Routing**: Understand basic routing concepts to troubleshoot network issues effectively.
- Always back up critical data before testing network settings.
